            <h3>Programming (Computer Science). 2015-My Death.</h3>        
            <div class="lineSmall"></div>
            <p>
                I started programming back in 2015 making Minecraft P.E. Mods in JavaScript,
                which led me to Website Developing, after that I also learned the 'C' Languges.
                After programming in C/C#/C++, I discovered Python and have been using that ever since while learning
                other languages from esoteric ones like BrainFuck to old outdated ones like COBOL. Since I find obtaining
                knowledge quite fun, and technology is always evolving I try to keep myself up to date with the latest
                thing in tech... Though, I can never be %100 up to date, but atleast there would always be something new to discover!
                So, I am sure I will still be getting educated until my demise, and I think that is really neat!
            </p>

            <h3>Gloucester High School. 2017-2020</h3>
            <div class="lineSmall"></div>
            <p>
                Finding out there was a Computer Science class and equipped with my already obtained knowledge,
                I decided to attend so I could find some fun at School, that didn't involve not being there or just hanging out with friends.
                As expected, it was fun and I even got to learn more things (even if they were stepping stones to what I already knew).
                I learned about the program Scratch and the Turing Language, then started learning more of the hardware side,
                and Binaries which I also enjoyed and found myself studying those topics and others in my spare time.

                It was also encouraging that the teacher was great at what he did, he seemed to also enjoy learning and teaching
                which helped keep the class more engaging than others... It was also nice having my work shown as a good example of what to do as well! :)

            <h3>Algonquin College. Future Plans (Fall 2024)</h3>
            <div class="lineSmall"></div>
            <p>
                I am soon going to be attending Algonquin College to obtain a degree in Computer Science.
                Hopefully, it could help me get a job in Cyber-Security.
                I think that is quite an important field in this world of always evolving technology.

            <br>
            <p>
                In addition to Computer Science, I enjoy regular Sciences, and try to partake in as much experiments as I can.
                Hopefully one day, I would be able to do bigger scale, helpful experiments intead of electrolizing Hydrogen and Oxygen from water
                or making carbonated water by catching carbon dioxide in a balloon from a baking soda/vinegar reaction because of boredom.
