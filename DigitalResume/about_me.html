            Hello my name is Aaron Cassell. I was born on the 15th of May on a Wednesday in the year 2002.
            There are plenty things I can put here, but I will only highlight a few points and a couple things about that point.
            This page will range from talking about What I like to do for fun, what sparks joy in my life and where I plan to go in my life.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h4>Hobbies.</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="lineSmallOut"></div>
        <p>
            I enjoy doing a bunch of things and open to trying new outlets to pass my time and express some creativity, but I will only touch on a few of them here.
            A few things that I really like to do is riding my skateboard, playing my guitar and this - programming, even though HTML is not exactly programming,
            but it still requrires writing syntax so by that standard, I count it.
            <br>
            When I was 5 I obtained my first small skateboard, I found it fun to skate in my grandparents basement even though I had no clue what I was doing.
            A few years later, I discovered Tony Hawk's Game Franchise, which made me like skateboarding even more and trying new things.
            Now, I still skate, it feels freeing, helps me de-stress and I keep getting better and still learning new things.
            I think it would be cool to become a professional skateboarder, and would like to acheive such title one day!
            <br>
            I spoke about most of it on the main page in the <a href="index.html#educations">education section</a>, so I will try to keep it brief.
            When I was around 14 years-old I found out about modding Minecraft P.E. so I tried, which started my road to Computer Science.
            After learning multiple new languages and writing some small scripts and a discord bot, I started a class in high school to pass time,
            which led me to learning more of the hardware side, and into robotics.
            I am attempting to persue a career in Cyber-Security, so I can use that knowledge to 'break' things to make them stronger and better.
            <br>
            Sometime in early 2023 I started playing the guitar, and i find it quite fun. Learned a couple songs and now I find I enjoy music a little more.
            I think it would be interesting to create a song of my own someday, but for right now, I just play for the fun of it, and try different things to understand it better!
            <br>

        <h4>Interests.</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="lineSmallOut"></div>
        <p>
            I like a lot of things but much like the previous section, I will be only highlighting some of them in this part.
            Some of the things I enjoy in life are; learning, technology and wildlife.
            <br>
            Ever since I can remember I always found learning quite fun.
            I would always take apart my toys and gadgets to learn how they function and put them back together like nothing happened... most of the time.
            Sometimes a part would break or get lost, so I would improvise so I can continue using the object, if that doesn't work I would try to reuse the parts for other things.
            Other times, I would find ways to 'uprade' an item, whether it be making a nerf gun shoot stronger, or a simple cosmetic change.
            <br>
            My first real experience with technology was with an old and not quite functioning computer monitor around the time of Minecraft Modding.
            It barely worked and did not know what wi-fi was, so I had to transfer files on my phone via a usb cord, which did let me use A.D.B. to root my Android.
            I was then able to update it ever so slightly so I could play old games and programs like Doom and Pinball, though it did teach me a lot about computers,
            and got me really interested in working with technology and computer systems.
            <br>
            My while life I loved wildlife, mainly cats, but any creature that is not human is cool with me.
            Whether it is learning about the differences in their biology and functionality to humans,
            or how a lot of them are pleasant to be around. They don't have (expressed) judgement for one which is nice.
            Especially when talking about pets, all of them are great if they are bonded with kindness,
            and can be really helpfull for when you feel sad or just want to hug a cute and cuddly animal! :)
            <br>

        <h4>Career Goals.</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="lineSmallOut"></div>
        <p>
            As I have said in the programming section of this page, I would love to persue a career in Cyber-Security.
            I find in this always evolving world where a lot of our important information lies upon the virtual networks,
            and there needs to be protection against attacks and scams. Even finding vulnerabilities as small as a unwanted glitch,
            is helpful since it could cause future issues. Maybe I could even create a tech company that does multiple Computer Science things,
            that could help the world or something...
            <br>
            <div class="lineMediumOut"></div>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Welp, that seems to be all I can think of to write about myself,
            maybe I will update this page in the future if I haven't put it in the very back of my mind and forget about it. :)
